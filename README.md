## Experiment /w S3 and Athena for Observability

### Purpose

Build a basic analytics and debugging service with S3 and Athena. The purpose is to learn how to build this service as well as how to utilize the concept of a wide event, where as much possible context is provided into one log as an "event record" for a provided resource rather than a series of logs one must search through or utilize sequentially.

### Infrastructure 
1. Lambda /w url
2. S3 bucket
3. Athena table? service? etc.
4. delivery mechanism
